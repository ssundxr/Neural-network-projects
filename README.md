Neural Network Image Classifier

📌 Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model using a neural network. The model processes uploaded images and classifies them into categories based on trained data. It is implemented using Python and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras.

🚀 Features

✔️ Supports grayscale and color image classification✔️ Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate predictions✔️ Implemented in Python with TensorFlow/Keras✔️ Allows users to upload images and receive classification results✔️ Easy to run with minimal dependencies

🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuralnetwork.git  

Navigate to the project directory

cd neuralnetwork  

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Run the script

python main.py  

📷 Usage

Upload an image through the provided UI or command-line interface.

The neural network will process the image and predict the category.

View classification results along with confidence scores.

Use the model for real-time applications or further improvements.
