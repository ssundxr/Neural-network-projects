Overview
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to build a deep learning model to classify lung cancer from medical images. The model is trained on a dataset of lung images and optimized using Bayesian optimization to achieve the best hyperparameters.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Lung Cancer 105k Dataset, which contains 105,000 lung images of size 768x768 pixels. The dataset is divided into two classes:
Cancerous
Non-Cancerous
The dataset is available on Kaggle.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Images are resized to 128x128 pixels and converted to grayscale.
The dataset is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets using ImageDataGenerator.
2. CNN Model
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using TensorFlow/Keras.
The model architecture includes:
Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation.
Max-pooling layers.
A fully connected layer with dropout for regularization.
A sigmoid output layer for binary classification.
3. Bayesian Optimization
Hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, filters, dropout rate) are optimized using Bayesian Optimization via scikit-optimize.
The optimization process uses a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model to minimize the negative validation accuracy.
4. Training and Evaluation
The model is trained for 10 epochs with the best hyperparameters.
Validation accuracy is used to evaluate the model's performance.
5. Prediction
A file upload widget is provided to upload new images for prediction.
The trained model predicts whether the uploaded image is cancerous or non-cancerous.
