Neural Network Image Classifier

📌 Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model using a neural network. The model processes uploaded images and classifies them into categories based on trained data. It is implemented using Python and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras.

🚀 Features

✔️ Supports grayscale and color image classification✔️ Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate predictions✔️ Implemented in Python with TensorFlow/Keras✔️ Allows users to upload images and receive classification results✔️ Easy to run with minimal dependencies

🛠️ Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1.Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuralnetwork.git  

2.Navigate to the project directory
- cd neuralnetwork  

3.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

4.Install dependencies
- pip install -r requirements.txt  

📷 Usage
a.Upload an image through the provided UI or command-line interface.
b.The neural network will process the image and predict the category.
c.View classification results along with confidence scores.
d.Use the model for real-time applications or further improvements.
